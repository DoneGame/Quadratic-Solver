# Quadratic equation solver

### Simple CLI program for solving equations of the form axÂ² + bx + c = 0 with any coefficients

*Created at the MIPT summer school for first-year students of the program "System Programming and Applied Math"*

## Dependencies

- `GCC`
- `Make`
- `Doxygen (optional)`

## Run program

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoneGame/Quadratic-Solver.git
cd Quadratic-Solver
```

Compile code

```bash
make
```

Finally, run executable file

```bash
quad.exe
```

## Possible arguments

*Can be called in any order and any number of times*

<pre>--solve            Solving quadratic equation. Coefficients must be in form -s a b c</pre> 
<pre>--help  	   Prints information about argumets</pre>
<pre>--test_file_help   Gives information about format of file with tests</pre>
<pre>--test             Testing internal functions</pre>
<pre>--epsilon          Printing current value of constant for NonZero()</pre>
<!-- --cat                Prints poltorashka -->
